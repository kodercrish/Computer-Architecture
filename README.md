# Computer Architecture

This repository contains various projects and assignments related to Computer Architecture. The projects demonstrate practical implementations and concepts in Python, Assembly, and C.

## Introduction
This repository is a collection of projects and assignments developed to understand and implement concepts in Computer Architecture. The projects cover various topics such as CPU design, memory management, instruction set architecture, and more.

## Project Structure
There are two projects inside this repsitory.
1. IAS processor : This includes a processor based on the IAS architecture, with accompanying Assembly and C code to execute a specific sequence of instructions.
2. MIPS processor : This includes a processor based on the MIPS architecture, with accompanying Assembly and C code to execute a specific sequence of instructions. The Assembly code is written in the MARS simulator, and there are three codes for certain tasks performed by the MIPS processor.
3. Cache Implementation : This includes a cache implementation code which give the overall cache hits and cache misses for a given output using a particular cache replacement policy. 
For further details please refer to the documentation inside each project.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies are used in this repository:
- **Python**: 79.5%
- **Assembly**: 10.3%
- **C**: 10.2%

## Usage
Each project has its own set of instructions for running and testing. Refer to the guide files within the respective project directories for detailed instructions.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
